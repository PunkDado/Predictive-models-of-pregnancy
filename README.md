# Predictive-models-of-pregnancy


This repository contains codes and models described in our paper, Predictive models of pregnancy based on data from a preconception cohort study.

To run the models:

Step 1: Start with the section “load dataset”:
-Load the dataset including the features and the label, in the format of pandas dataframe

Step 2: Go through the section “Statistical Feature Selection” 

Step 3: Go through the section “implementation of the models” to implement  
-full models (i.e., least parsimonious) that contain all variables selected after statistical feature selection  
-sparse models that contain variables selected after both statistical feature selection and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)  
-parsimonious models that limit recursive feature elimination to select a model with up to 15 variables
