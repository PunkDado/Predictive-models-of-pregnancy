Data collection
Female participants completed a baseline questionnaire at enrollment, on which they reported data on sociodemographic factors, behavioral factors, medical and reproductive history, and selected male partner characteristics. Ten days after enrollment, participants were invited to complete the diet history questionnaire II (DHQ II). The DHQ II was designed by the National Cancer Institute and the first version of the DHQ was validated against 24-h dietary recalls in a USA population (Subar et al., 2001; Millen et al., 2006). In validation studies, correlations between energy-adjusted, DHQ-reported food servings and 24-h recall-reported food servings ranged from 0.43 for other starchy vegetables to 0.84 for milk. Based on dietary factors reported via the DHQ II, we assessed overall diet quality using the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) score (Guenther et al., 2013). Participants completed bimonthly follow-up questionnaires for 12 months, or until reported pregnancy, cessation of pregnancy attempts, study withdrawal or loss to follow-up, whichever occurred first. Data on menstrual cycle dates, pregnancy attempts and pregnancy status were obtained via the baseline questionnaire and updated on each follow-up questionnaire. A complete list of the 163 variables included in this analysis is provided in Table I.

We conceptualized race as a social construct that serves as a rough proxy for exposure to interpersonal and structural racism.

Menstrual cycle length and regularity were assessed via the following questions on the baseline questionnaire: (i) Did your period become regular on its own without the use of hormonal contraceptives such as the pill, patch, implants or injectables (regular in a way so you can usually predict about when the next period will start)? (ii) Within the past couple of years, has your menstrual period been regular? Please think about those times you were not using hormonal contraceptives. (iii) Thinking about the time(s) when you have not used hormonal contraceptives, what is your typical menstrual cycle length? That is, the number of days from the first day of one menstrual period to the first day of your next menstrual period.

Outcomes
We developed three models to predict (i) pregnancy in fewer than 12 menstrual cycles; (ii) pregnancy within 6 menstrual cycles; and (iii) the average probability of pregnancy per menstrual cycle. We chose these outcome measures to reflect clinically relevant definitions of infertility, subfertility and fecundability (Evers, 2002; Gnoth et al., 2005). We defined the first outcome as fewer than 12 menstrual cycles, rather than ≤12 cycles, because participants who conceive in the twelfth cycle are unlikely to have the opportunity to identify and report their pregnancy before the end of the study period. For the first two models, we used a dataset with one observation per participant and excluded participants who were lost to follow-up before reaching a study endpoint (for the first model, N = 3195; for the second model, N = 3476). For the third model (fecundability), we included all participants under observation regardless of follow-up duration (N = 4133).

Model I (pregnancy in fewer than 12 menstrual cycles)
Model II (pregnancy within 6 menstrual cycles)
Model III (fecundability), we fit a discrete-time analog of the Cox proportional hazards model with cycle number as the time scale, allowing for delayed entry into the risk set (i.e. if a participant already had one cycle of pregnancy attempt at enrollment). Participants contributed at-risk cycles to the analysis from enrollment until reported pregnancy or a censoring event, which included initiation of fertility treatment, withdrawal from the study, cessation of pregnancy attempts, loss-to-follow-up or 12 cycles of pregnancy attempt, whichever occurred first. We present results for the full model after statistical feature selection, as described above, and for a parsimonious model. To derive the parsimonious model, we fit separate Cox models with each individual predictor and then sorted the variables based on each model’s concordance index. The concordance index is similar to the AUC (described below) but accounts for event time and loss to follow-up (Schmid et al., 2016; Longato et al., 2020). We selected the top fifteen variables and forced non-selected levels of polytomous categorical variables into the final model, as described above.
