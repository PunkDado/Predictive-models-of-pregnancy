# Predictive-models-of-pregnancy


This repository contains codes and models described in our paper, Predictive models of pregnancy based on data from a preconception cohort study.

To use models I or II, follow the instructions through "model_I_II.py".  
To use model III, follow the instructions through "model_III.py".  

Besides, we provide an example for using our models. In this example, you are asked to enter a subject's data, and our models predict the probability of conception of that subject.  
To use this example, download the folder "PRESTO_example" and run the jupyter notebook file "run_example.ipynb".
