# Predictive-models-of-pregnancy


This repository contains codes and models described in our paper, Predictive models of pregnancy based on data from a preconception cohort study.

To run the models, open the file "model_I_II.py":    

Step 1: Start with the section “load dataset”:  
-Load the dataset including the features and the label, in the format of pandas dataframe

Step 2: Go through the section “Statistical Feature Selection” 

Step 3: Go through the section “implementation of the models” to implement:  
-Full models (i.e., least parsimonious) that contain all variables selected after sStatistical Feature Selection  
-Sparse models that contain variables selected after both Statistical Feature Selection and Recursive Feature Elimination  
-Parsimonious models that limit recursive feature elimination to select a model with up to 15 variables
